      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/baseball.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Michael Hernandez">

      <p> I grew up in East Petersburg, PA in Lancaster County which is located in south central Pennsylvania. I graduated from Hempfield High School in 2014 and went on to study accounting and play baseball at Hood College in Frederick, MD in the fall of 2014. I studied at Hood for three years before taking a leave of absence because I needed to get elbow surgery done on my throwing arm and rehab my arm for six months. After I left school and had come home for surgery, I later found out that my financial aid had not gone through for the last semester I attended school and so I was left with an enormous payment just for me to be able to go back to school and finish my last year. I decided not to go back to school because I had no way of coming up with the amount of money I needed just to register for another semester.</p>

      <p> After I left Hood, I worked at multiple jobs from May 2018 till now and currently I am working full-time as a production associate for Sonoco Thermosafe while I am in the Coding program. I currently reside in Norristown, PA with my grandparents and have been here for the past seven months. </p>

      <p> I joined the Coding Bootcamp because I wanted to do something that interests me and also that has stability in the job field and quality pay. I love the idea of working remotely from home because you can live anywhere in the world and still work your job. I love working on the computer and learning all kinds of new things and want to be successful in the program and learn a lot and also achieve my main goal of finding my career. </p>
